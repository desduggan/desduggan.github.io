				<legend>about me</legend>
				<p>Currently, I study Systems Engineering and Computer Science at <a href="http://wustl.edu/">Washington University in St. Louis</a>. In the last three years, I discovered passions that include entreprenuership, technology, and fitness.</p>

				<p>Outside of class, I row six days per week with the Washington University men's <a href="http://www.crew.wustl.edu/">varsity crew team</a>. We compete in all major regattas in the midwestern and eastern regions of the United States. In addition, as the president of the team, I actively manage team operations and strategy.</p>

				<p>My projects include Parq and Rowing Analytics.</p>

				<p>This summer I will be interning in the Bay Area with the <a href="http://www.accenture.com/us-en/technology/technology-labs/Pages/index.aspx">Accenture Technology Labs</a>, and when I return in the fall, I plan on working part time with <a href="http://cultivationcapital.com/">Cultivation Capital</a> as part of the due diligence team.</p>
