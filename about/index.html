				<legend>about me</legend>
				<p>Currently, I study Systems Engineering and Computer Science at <a href="http://wustl.edu/">Washington University in St. Louis</a>. In the last three years, I discovered passions that include entreprenuership, technology, and fitness.</p>

				<p>Outside of class, I row six days per week with the Washington University men's <a href="http://www.crew.wustl.edu/">varsity crew team</a>. We compete in all major regattas in the midwestern and eastern regions of the United States. In addition, as the president of the team, I ensure the safe transportation of our equipment and team members, lead the executive board, and manage our relations with the St. Louis community.</p>

				<p>I am also the director of <a href="http://www.wute.vc">wute.vc</a>, an organization that hosts speakers in venture capital and entrepreneurship for the Washington University community. We are the primary application processor for a startup accelerator for wustl students called WuStart@OpenDNS. </p>

				<p>In my spare time, I enjoy building web and mobile applications, tasting new wines, and camping. </p>

				<p>Most recently, I interned with the <a href="http://www.accenture.com/us-en/technology/technology-labs/Pages/index.aspx">Accenture Technology Labs</a> in San Jose, CA.  </p>
