<p>Sweep is a iOS and web based rowing workout tracker.  Here's what it does:</p>

<ul>
<li>Take a photo of an erg screen and auto generate a workout log from the image.</li>
<li>Manually record a workout by logging each segment / interval.</li>
<li>Save all of your workouts and have them stored with a cloud database.</li>
<li>Get analytics about a workout, ie. how your 2k time progressed.</li>
<li>Affiliate yourself with a team and then show rankings for a workout on a given date.</li>
</ul>


<p><a href="https://github.com/danielcorin">Danny Corin</a> and I have been building this app in our spare time.  We both row on the Washington University crew team and are rising seniors in engineering.</p>
<p>Here's some screenshots! </p>
