How many times have you been frustrated by trying to find an open laundry machine on a college campus? My answer to that question is: A LOT. For my Junior and Senior years at school, I lived in my fraternity house with 37 other guys. It was great fun except when Sunday rolled around, and you needed to use one of the two laundry machines in the house. 

Naturally, my roommates and I devised a technological solution to this problem. Using an accelerometer extension to the Arduino controller, we posted the status of the laundry machines (in use or not in use) to a webapp that everyone in the house could access.
