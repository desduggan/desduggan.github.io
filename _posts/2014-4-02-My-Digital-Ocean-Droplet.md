Having a server to use as a sandbox for my side projects has been on my todo list for a while, but school work kept it a low priority until this weekend when I had some time to get one up and running. 

Specifically, I wanted one that was capable of serving Django applications because it's my modern framework of choice. Surprisingly though, I couldn't find a solid end to end guide to follow, so I pieced together a few different sources and figured some stuff out on my own. 

Below is a link to a step by step guide I wrote for anyone trying to do the same thing. I tested as much as I could during development, but I haven't gone through it with a new machine (feedback is appreciated!).
