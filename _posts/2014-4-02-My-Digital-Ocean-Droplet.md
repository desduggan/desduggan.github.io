I've always wanted my own cloud server to serve as a sandbox for my side projects, but frankly, I've always been a little intimidated by this stuff so I avoided it for a long time. Finally though, I allocated some time to get one up and running, and I was surprised at how simple it was. 

In less than 24 hours my Digital Ocean Droplet was serving a Django site based in a safe VirtualEnv and filling a MySQL database with scraped data from the web. It was not without challenges, however. One frustration I had was that I couldn't find one single tutorial to go from nothing to Django capable server, so I made one that I hope will be useful to people looking to make their own servers.
