# Amazon Prime Air
*Why not?*

On Sunday evening, Jeff Bezos revealed his plans to introduce unmanned quad-copters into Amazon's already extensive distribution network to deliver small goods in under thirty minutes. The copters look to be about the size of a medium sized Amazon package and are expected to be able to lift up to 10 pounds. If Bezos indeed makes this a reality, it could revolutionize modern supply chains and nudge the status quo towards a future of flying cars and robots. 

The reality, as many people have pointed out since the announcement, is that Bezos will have to overcome extraordinary hurdles including a [recent statement](http://msnbcmedia.msn.com/i/MSNBC/Sections/NEWS/A_U.S.%20news/A_U.S.%20news/US-news-PDFs/131201_FAA_Drones_Roadmap_2013.pdf) by the Federal Aviation Administration that regulations for Civil Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) will not be passed until the 2022-2026 timeframe. Considering the massive amount of policy and regulatory infrastructure that has to be built to manage swarms of autonomous blade wielding terrors, a 2022 prediction is probably a little optimistic. How would you feel about swarms of delivery drones descending on Manhattan? Consider the case that one of these small helicopters may be carrying a small bomb? 

Regardless, Jeff Bezos didn't go through the trouble of coordinating a wide spanning marketing effort for a project he knows isn't going live for at least a decade for nothing. If you know anything about Jeff Bezos, you know that he is highly intelligent and forward thinking. I imagine him viewing his life as a giant game of chess, and he's thinking 4 or 5 moves ahead. I think that the release of Amazon One Prime was a tactic in a larger game. 

Since Jeff Bezos left his cushy six figure trading role with D.E. Shaw in the early 1990's to found The Everything Store, he has always struggled to match the precise charisma of Steve Jobs, a prominent rival. Product releases like the Kindle and Amazon Prime went with little fanfare, but nonetheless took the industry by surprise when customers came in droves. Maybe this release was the first time Jeff got his shit together and captured the imagination of the public. 

To that end, the [Amazon Prime Air Youtube video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98BIu9dpwHU) logged 7.5 million views in one day, and everyone and their grandmother on the internet has something to say about it (apparently including me). Now, consider the timing of this release: Bezos appeared on 60 Minutes Sunday evening, the night before Cyber Monday. If there was any way to maximize views on the Amazon homepage where the "lightning deals" are listed, this would surely do that. Given that since Amazon's inception, the holiday season has contributed significantly to annual sales, Jeff may have boosted his company's short term sales and share price.

However, it would be short sighted for me to say that this was the only reason Bezos got out there to make this announcement. Take the scenario that Amazon Prime Air was not announced and nobody makes any such announcement until the FAA gets around to passing the required regulations in 2025. This would be 12 years of lost progress. Amazon has clearly made significant progress towards the technology component of this innovation; why would they sit back and wait? 

Bezos has always taken pride in the fact that the customer is far and beyond number one in Amazon's business model. He would happily lose millions of dollars to ensure that his customers have the lowest price on their favorite item. If Bezos thinks that the customer would benefit from having 30 minute delivery by a potentially dangerous autonomous helicopter, he's going to damn well make sure that happens.

The genius in the release of Amazon Prime Air a decade ahead of its time, is that it puts indirect pressure on the FAA to prioritize passing regulations. If nobody did what Bezos did on Sunday for another 10 years, the FAA wouldn't have any incentive to pass UAS policy, but if millions of U.S. citizens are buzzing about needing UAS regulations, then maybe FAA Chairman Michael Huerta will have a little fire under his seat. 

Look at Google and the driver-less car. Since they announced the first model at [least three states](http://finance.yahoo.com/news/california-governor-signs-driverless-cars-225332005.html) have since passed laws allowing automous car testing. Such large visionary innovations require a lot things to align and companies like Google and Amazon have no option, but to take it step by step. 

Ultimately, Bezos made this release knowing very well that he won't realistically release Amazon Prime Air to the public for a decade. He injected a bit of hype into Amazon's public image, and he was able to exert pressure on the FAA without having to leverage any of his own personal influence. No, Huerta is unlikely to cut his timeline in half for the sake of Jeff Bezos' pet project, but sometimes you have to make do with what options you have on the table. Amazon Prime Air is not a make or brake innovation for Amazon. To Jeff Bezos, this is simply another move in a long game.
