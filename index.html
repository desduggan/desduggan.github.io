        <p>Hello! Thanks for visiting. Here's a bit about me. If you want to reach out, shoot me a <a href="mailto:desmondrduggan@gmail.com">mail</a>. </p>
<p>I am a software engineer living in San Francisco and working with Accentureâ€™s global R&D organization. 
</p>
<p>I code full stack mostly in Python and Javascript with an eye for design, and I bring ideas from a pencil sketch to docker deployment with PEP 8 in mind. 
</p>
<p>I love building beautiful and impactful software with smart people. Outside of work, I am a triathlete trying to hack my mind and body.
